## Dataset
The dataset contains flight details of 10683 flights travelling across India in year 2019.
The dataset is extracted from Kaggle.
It includes information such as departure,source,destination, Date_of_Journey,duration.

## Queries
In most of the Queries we will be using TIME() and DATE() functions.

## Functions
Some of the date and time function used in Queries are - 

> [MONTH()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_month): to extract the month from a timestamp

> [YEAR()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_year): to extract the year from a timestamp

> [TIMESTAMP()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_timestamp): to represent the date and time in a format

> [DATE_ADD()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_date-add): add an interval of time to date value

> [SEC_TO_TIME()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_sec-to-time):Convert seconds to 'HH:MM:SS' format

## Requirements
To run the above queries the software you need are:
